# Sites are added automatically by orchestrator/new-site.mjs
# Each site runs on its own port, Caddy (on the host) routes domains to them.
#
# Caddy is already running on the EC2 instance at /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
# The orchestrator generates Caddy snippets in caddy/sites/ which get
# included into the main Caddyfile on the server.
